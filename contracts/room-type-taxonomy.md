# Room-Type Taxonomy

**Status: Draft v0.1 · Published by THIS program; consumed by the dossier program**

This is the controlled vocabulary for `room_type_code` in `room_program.json`. It is
deliberately built from **LAUSD's own rule-bearing room names** — the room types their
standards actually attach requirements to (water temperature lists in SDG 3.4-D, drain
rules in 3.4-B, fixture commentary throughout Guide Spec 22 1000, restroom/fountain
rules in SDG 2.1-J/K). It will grow during knowledge-base ingestion; codes are append-only
(never reuse or repurpose a code — same discipline LAUSD applies to fixture schedule
numbers).

The dossier program maps `name_as_drawn` → `room_type_code` where it can (use the
aliases column; matching is case/punctuation-insensitive). Anything unmapped ships with
`room_type_code: null` and this program's exception queue classifies it with one click.

**Water class legend** — the domestic water temperature service the room's fixtures get
(SDG 3.4-D): `HC` hot+cold · `T` tempered only · `TP` tepid (emergency fixtures) ·
`C` cold only · `M` mixed by fixture (see hooks) · `—` typically no plumbing.
